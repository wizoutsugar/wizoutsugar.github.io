  CyberSecurity Consultant based in Egypt. Currently working primarily on Offensive Security Engagements such as External, Internal PenTesting, Red teaming &amp;amp; Web Application Testing. I have a huge interest in Cyber Sec/InfoSec and regularly spend my time researching new vulnerabilities, learning something new, or finding bugs on industry-recognized security platforms such as Synack &amp;amp; BugCrowd. Here&amp;rsquo;s where I dump all my ideas and things I learn.     root@shm:~/dev/shm# cat cert.

          1. Red Team  The purpose of a red team is to simulate a genuine, real-life threat to an organisation to improve people, processes and technology. They&amp;rsquo;re given a specific goal:  Demonstrating access to business-critical information or measure blue teams&#39; detection and response policies and will identify gaps in the organisation&amp;rsquo;s defences, monitoring and incident response capabilities to reach that goal.   Red Team Exercises focus on an end-to-end assessment of the entire organization.
